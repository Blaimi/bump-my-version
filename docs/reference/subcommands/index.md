# Subcommand reference

Bump-my-version uses subcommands to focus its functionality.

- `bump` triggers the version incrementing workflow
- `replace` replaces the version in files without triggering a version increment.
- `sample-config` helps new users configure bumpy-my-version by printing a sample configuration file.
- `show` provides access to current configuration information.
- `show-bump` helps developers understand the current versioning convention by showing the possible versions resulting from the `bump` subcommand.
